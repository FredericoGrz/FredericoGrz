# Welcome to my GitHub!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Antonio Gomes, and I'm a Front End Engineer passionate about crafting captivating digital realms. Welcome to my GitHub, where you can find information about me, my projects, and more.

## About Me

I'm a 28-year-old American who's found a home in Brazil. When I'm not on my keyboard, I'm on the mats practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsuâ€”I'm proud to say I'm rocking a blue belt! My appetite for learning new technologies is insatiable, and the prospect of teaming up on thrilling projects really gets me going. My ultimate aim? To shake up the way people connect and engage in the online world.

## Projects

### Stock Review

- Description: dynamic web app designed for exploring stock prices with real-time accuracy. I've personally woven together the magic of Tailwind CSS and ReCharts libraries to create something truly exciting. An app that lets you explore the stock market like never before! Thanks to the Finnhub API, I've brought real-time stock listings, intricate details, and historical price tales right to your fingertips. Working on this project has been an absolute joy, and seeing the end result fills me with pride. Plus, I've made sure the app dances seamlessly on all devices because I believe everyone deserves a smooth experience.
